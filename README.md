# Week 1
- I have encountered a new but weird course which is Discrete Mathematics.
- The first problem given to us about the knaves and knights is confusing.
- I learned that a proposition is a statement that is either true or false.
- I learned how to understand the Truth table of different Logical Connectives.
- I learned new symbols like ∧ for conjunction, ∨ for disjunction, ⊕ for  exclusive or,  → for conditional and ↔ for biconditional.

 #Week 2
- I was very excited to know more about this course.
- We were introduced to a new topic which were Proof by logical equivalences, Predicate/Quantification logic and Rules of Inference.
- Logical Equivalences have 10 laws which are:
  * Identity Laws
  * Domination Laws
  * Negation Laws
  * Double Negation Law
  * Idempotent Laws
  * Commutative Laws
  * Associative Laws
  * Distributive Laws
  * De Morgan's Laws
  * Absorption Laws
- Next was Predicate Logic which is "concerned not only with logical relations between sentences or propositions as WHOLES, but also their internal structure in terms of SUBJECT and PREDICATE.
- He gave us an assignment to prove if Superman exists or not. Eventually we arrived to the conclusion that he does not exist. How sad...
- Following that, he also discussed the two quantifiers; the Existential quantifier (∃x) and Universal quantifier (∀x)
- ∀x P(x) is true when P(x) is true for every x and false if there is an x for which P(x) is false.
- ∃x P(x) is true when there is an x for which P(x) is true and false if P(x) is false for every x.
- Lastly he introduced the different Rules of Inference which are:
  * Modus Ponens
  * Modus Tollens
  * Hypothetical syllogism
  * Disjunctive syllogism
  * Addition
  * Simplification
  * Conjuction
  * Resolution

# Week 3
- I'm about to watch the tutorial videos.
