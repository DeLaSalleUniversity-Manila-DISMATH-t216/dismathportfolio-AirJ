# Week 1
- I have encountered a new but weird course which is Discrete Mathematics.
- The first problem given to us about the knaves and knights is confusing.
- I learned that a proposition is a statement that is either true or false.
- I learned how to understand the Truth table of different Logical Connectives.
- I learned new symbols like ∧ for conjunction, ∨ for disjunction, ⊕ for  exclusive or,  → for conditional and ↔ for biconditional.

 #Week 2
- I was very excited to know more about this course.
- We were introduced to a new topic which were Proof by logical equivalences, Predicate/Quantification logic and Rules of Inference.
- Logical Equivalences have 10 laws which are:
  * Identity Laws
  * Domination Laws
  * Negation Laws
  * Double Negation Law
  * Idempotent Laws
  * Commutative Laws
  * Associative Laws
  * Distributive Laws
  * De Morgan's Laws
  * Absorption Laws
- Next was Predicate Logic which is "concerned not only with logical relations between sentences or propositions as WHOLES, but also their internal structure in terms of SUBJECT and PREDICATE.
- He gave us an assignment to prove if Superman exists or not. Eventually we arrived to the conclusion that he does not exist. How sad...
- Following that, he also discussed the two quantifiers; the Existential quantifier (∃x) and Universal quantifier (∀x)
- ∀x P(x) is true when P(x) is true for every x and false if there is an x for which P(x) is false.
- ∃x P(x) is true when there is an x for which P(x) is true and false if P(x) is false for every x.
- Lastly he introduced the different Rules of Inference which are:
  * Modus Ponens
  * Modus Tollens
  * Hypothetical syllogism
  * Disjunctive syllogism
  * Addition
  * Simplification
  * Conjuction
  * Resolution

# Week 3
- I'm about to watch the tutorial videos. 
- Done watching the recommended tutorial videos, it helped me to understand our topics easily.
- We discussed the different methods of proof which are:
  * Direct Proof
  * Proof by Contraposition (Indirect)
  * Vacuous Proof
  * Trivial Proof
  * Proof by Contradiction (Indirect)
  * Proof by Equivalence
- In Direct Proof, we assume p to be true and we should show that q is also true.
- In Proof by Contraposition, we assume not q is true and show that not p is true.
- In Vacuous Proof, we show that p is false, because p->q must be true when p is false.
- In Trivial Proof, we show that q is true, it follows that p->q must also be true.

# Week 4
- We were introduced in another proof which is Proof by Contradiction.
- To prove a statement using this kind of proof, we must:
 * Assume that P is true and that Q is false.
 * Derive a Contradiction
 * Conclude that if P is true, Q must be true.
- Another proof was introduced and it was Proof by Equivalence.
- To prove this, we must show that p->q and q->p are true.
- Mathematical Induction was reinforced.
- In performing this method, we must follow the two steps: 
 * 1. Basic Step
 * 2. Inductive Step
- Recursive Statements are introduced.

# Week 5
- Recursive Algorithm was discussed.
- Programs of factorial and of power rule were part of recursive algorithm.
- Program Verification was introduced and it helps us know how to present proof of correctness of programs.
- Zeno's Paradox and Power Series were introduced.
- Partial Correctness
 * HOARE TRIPLE p{S}q
- Set is an unordered collection of distinct objects. It has different relationships:
 * Union
 * Intersection
 * Difference
 * Symmetric Difference

# Week 6
- We discussed functions.
- It is the relationship between inputs and outputs.
- I learned about the difference of range and codomain.
- Different types of functions:
 * One-To-One Function 
 * Onto Function 
 * Bijection

# Week 7
- Algorithms were our new topic.
- It must have a precondition and a postcondition.
- Linear Search-one by one search
- Binary Search-finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.

# Week 8
- I learned about new Algorithms.
- Bubble sort, insertion and greedy algorithms were introduced.
- Bubble sort - smaller elements "bubble" to the top as they are interchanged with larger elements. The larger elements "sink" to the bottom.
- Insertion sort - a simple sorting algorithm that begins with the second element.
- Greedy Algorithm selects the best choice at each step.

# Week 9
- Our prof introduced sorting algorithm.
- There are two types of sorting
 * Bubble Sort
 * Insertion Sort
- We were also introduced in greedy algorithm.
- It works by providing a set of denomination arranged in increasing order. 

# Week 10
- We were introduced to growth function.
- Growth functions can be approximated using Big-O, Big-Omega, and Big-Theta notation.
- Big-O - used for upper bound.
- Big-Omega - used for lower bound.
- Big-Theta - used for upper and lower bound.
- Complexity of Algorithms (from lowest to highest)
 * Constant Complexity
 * Logarithm Complexity
 * Linear Complexity
 * n log n Complexity
 * Polynomial Complexity
 * Exponential Complexity
 * Factorial Complexity

# Week 11
- No classes

# Week 12
- Graph Theory - a structure that consists of vertices and edges.
- Edges - connects the vertices.
- Degree - the number of edges incident with a node.
- Handshaking Theorem: 2e = Sum[deg(v)]
- Euler path - a (open) walk where all edges are covered once
- Euler circuit - a circuit containing every edge of a graph
- Eulers formula: regions = edges - vertices + 2
- Hamilton path - an open walk where all nodes are covered.
- Hamilton circuit - passes to through every vertex exactly once and returns to the vertex where it started.
- Pendant is a one degree node
- Kuratowski's Theorem - a graph is nonplanar if and only if it contains a subgraph homeophobic to K3,3 and K5.

# Week 13
- Graph Coloring - assigning a color to a node or vertex so that there will be no adjacent nodes will have the same color.
- Four Color Theorem - the chromatic number of a planar graph is no greater than four.
- Cycle with odd number of vertices - chromatic 3
- Cycle with even number of vertices - chromatic 2
- Trees - is a connected undirected graph with no simple circuits
- Rooted tree- a tree in which a special node is singled out
- Ordered Tree -  a rooted tree which are arranged in increasing order
